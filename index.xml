<h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
<p>Hello to whoever is reading this! You’re currently on my first ever blog post!</p>
<p>I am no big writer and this is my first genuine attempt at creating and publishing posts that are meaningful to me. Writing has always been intimidating to me. I’ve always hated, it but this will serve as a starting point towards being more comfortable putting my ideas into words and sharing them online to super duper cool readers like you.</p>
<p>The main reason why I have decided to start blogging seriously is that I want to value creation over passive consumption and to keep track my learning and ideas.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>Currently, I am CS student entering McGill University in Montreal Canada. I’m interested in AI, specifically anything related to LLMs whether that be research or engineering. I love to train models! I try my best, but it is a daunting task with many pitfalls. I am also a RAG enthusiast; I’d love to learn more about it and develop apps or systems.</p>

<section id="what-to-expect" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>There is nothing set in stone for the near future as of writing this. Although one promise that I’ll try to uphold is sharing technical things like my learning journey in AI and software development or my random thoughts on random things.</p>
<hr>
<p>You’ve reached the end of my first ever blog post. This was just raw words from me. One day I will come back to this and cringe at it probably, but it is the risk that I am willing to take if the reward is becoming a better communicator.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading :)</p>
